## Setup instructions

Before you join the workshop, please make sure you have the most recent versions of R and RStudio installed on your computer. Here's how to get those programs:

<h3>R & RStudio</h3>

<p>
    <a href="https://www.r-project.org">R</a> is a programming language
    that is especially powerful for data exploration, visualization, and
    statistical analysis. To interact with R, we use
    <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/">RStudio</a>.
</p>


<h4 id="r-windows">Windows</h4>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0PjTAylwoU">Video Tutorial</a>
<p>
        Install R by downloading and running
        <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/release.htm">this .exe file</a>
        from <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/index.html">CRAN</a>.
        Also, please install the
        <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download">RStudio IDE</a>.
        Note that if you have separate user and admin accounts, you should run the
        installers as administrator (right-click on .exe file and select "Run as
        administrator" instead of double-clicking). Otherwise problems may occur later,
        for example when installing R packages.
</p>

<h4 id="r-macosx">macOS</h4>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-ly3kyxwEg">Video Tutorial</a>
<p>
        Install R by downloading and running
        <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/R-latest.pkg">this .pkg file</a>
        from <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/index.html">CRAN</a>.
        Also, please install the
        <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download">RStudio IDE</a>.
</p>

<h4 id="r-linux">Linux</h4>
<p>
        You can download the binary files for your distribution
        from <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/index.html">CRAN</a>. Or
        you can use your package manager (e.g. for Debian/Ubuntu
        run <code>sudo apt-get install r-base</code> and for Fedora run
        <code>sudo dnf install R</code>).  Also, please install the
        <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download">RStudio IDE</a>.
